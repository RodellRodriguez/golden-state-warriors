# golden-state-warriors
Playing with Web Scraping and Pandas functionality for self-learning. For Web Scraping I am using the requests library to scrape Shooting stats of Golden State Warriors team during the 2016-2017 season from http://stats.nba.com/ .

I used this http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/ to scrape the data in a JSON format and saved the data in a csv format.
